# I Invented Burrell
* Author: Andy Hertzfeld
* Story Date: January 1981
* Topics: Personality
* Characters: Burrell Smith, Jef Raskin
* Summary: Burrell imitates Jef

Burrell had a great sense of humor, and he was capable of performing devastating impersonations of everybody else on the Mac team, especially the authority figures.


  Whatever idea that you came up with, Jef Raskin had a tendency to claim that he invented it at some earlier point.  That trait was the basis of Burrell's impersonation of Jef.

  Jef had a slight stammer, which Burrell nailed perfectly.  Burrell began by folding his fingers together like Jef and then exclaiming in a soft, Jef-like voice, "Why, why, why, I invented the Macintosh!"

  Then Burrell would shift to his radio announcer voice, playing the part of an imaginary interviewer.  "No, I thought that Burrell invented the Macintosh", the interviewer would object.

  He'd shift back to his Jef voice for the punch line.

  "Why, why, why, I invented Burrell!"
