#  Folklore.org's Apple History (Markdown Export)

Andy Hertzfeld was an early Apple employee who created the amazing Folklore.org, which contains an oral history of Apple Inc. and the creation of the first Macintosh computer. These Folklore.org posts were all collected into the 320 page book [Revolution in the Valley](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/asin/0596007191), published by O'Reilly Media in 2004.
 
This project has extracted all the posts and their metadata from Folklore.org, cleaned up the markup, and converted them to Markdown for easier reading and converting to other formats.
 
 ## Why this project exists
 
Folklore.org is an unique source of incredible first hand content about Apple. Unfortunately the website and its content have some problems that make reading the content a poor experience:

* Does not have a mobile friendly layout
* Missing images
* Low res-thumbnails used in articles, requiring links out to high resolution ones
* Broken links
* CMS issues (posts 32-51 and 53-132 don't exist, breaking paging and navigation)
* Table-based layouts with complex and obtuse HTML markup.
* Accessibility issues (images without ALT text, etc)
* Formatting issues

I wanted to clean this content up and make it available to [Gemini Space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gemini_(protocol)). Luckily this content is licensed under [Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial 1.0 Generic (CC BY-NC 1.0)](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/1.0/), so it can be remixed into other mediums. I was also able to leverage the Wayback machine to find versions of the posts as they existed in the mid 2000s, to recover lost images.

## Gemini Mirror:

Gemtext versions of these posts are available on my Gemini Capsule: [gemini://gemi.dev/apple-folklore/](gemini://gemi.dev/apple-folklore/)

## Updated Images

Many of the images from Folklore.org are rare and hard to come across anywhere else. Unfortunately they tend to be lower resolution. Where possible I have updated the images with high-resolution sources with appropriate licenses.
