# Close Encounters of the Steve Kind
* Author: Tom Zito
* Story Date: September 1983
* Topics: Personality, Inspiration
* Characters: Steve Jobs, Donald Knuth, Lynn Takahashi
* Summary: Steve Jobs meets Donald Knuth

Steve had managed to get Don Knuth, the legendary Stanford professor of computer science, to give a lunchtime lecture to the Mac team.  Knuth is the author of at least a dozen books, including the massive and somewhat impenetrable trilogy "The Art of Computer Programming."  (For an amusing look at Knuth's heady self image, and his $2.56 reward program, see http//www-cs-faculty.stanford.edu/~knuth/books.html)

I was sitting in Steve's office when Lynn Takahashi, Steve's assistant, announced Knuth's arrival.  Steve bounced out of his chair, bounded over to the door and extended a welcoming hand.

"It's a pleasure to meet you, Professor Knuth," Steve said.  "I've read all of your books."

"You're full of shit," Knuth responded.
