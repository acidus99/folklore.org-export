Being the first "manufacturing" type person on the team, I showed up at Texaco Towers on my first day (August 17, 1981) at 7:30am. Rod showed up about 8:30 and said "who are you". After talking a while he showed me across the hall to my work space, pointed to a bean bag chair, and said "how's that?". Then the desk arrived.

Then George Crow, Burrell Smith and Dan Kotke found out I was there to help and the requests for sourcing started and didn't stop for the next 3 years.
